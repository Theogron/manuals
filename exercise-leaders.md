#### 1. Introduction, Icebreaker, Zulip

> CodeRefinery: We are working with students, researchers, and research software engineers from all disciplines to advance FAIRness of software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.
* Get familiar with HackMD 

[HackMD Mechanics](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/)

* Shortly introduce yourself in zoom
    * Who are you?
    * What do you do?
    * Where are you connecting from?

* If you want to, sign up for our [zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) to ask us anything, anytime. Use `#tools-workshop` during the workshop itself (you need to join the stream)


#### 2. Learners survey

(we used to ask learners to fill out a pre-workshop survey; this is discontinued now but results of the surveys still apply)
Let's take a quick look at previous courses survey results:

#### 3. What will happen during workshop?

[Schedule](https://coderefinery.org/2022-09-22-workshop/#schedule) with link to lesson material and exercises


##### Interactive stream?

* Instructor zoom is streamed
    * watch material, watch demo, type along
* Learner zoom for exercise sessions in breakoutrooms
* Stream for everyone
* interaction of everyone via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/workshop-2022-september)

#### 4. Exercise sessions

* instructor should clearly tell which exercises and for how long; if you don't know please clarify via HackMD

##### Teams?

###### preformed teams

* learners could sign up as team
* the goal is to keep preformed teams together 

###### single learner teams

* learners could sign up alone but request to do the exercises in team
* -> 2 open breakoutrooms
* Additional rooms for specific problem solving 
* Learners can also create own team 


##### Want extra help?

:::warning
**It is ok to not know something!**
:::

We have structures in place to help you if there is questions that you cannot answer (HackMD, expert helpers)

Use HackMD:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5UIwy5c.png)

* to ask (and answer) general questions that came up in your room 
* to call for more help from our expert helpers

##### During exercise sessions

[Helping in breakoutrooms](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/breakout-rooms-helping/#helpers-in-breakout-rooms)

* keep people talking and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to work on the exercises together.
* Greeting
* cameras
* Chat to “Everyone” in a breakout room only means people in that room.
* read the room and see what they want, but do provide encouragement to do something.
* keep time and ask for extra help with debugging


###### Strategies

**Strategy 1:** Encourage to share screen
**Strategy 2:** Everyone does exercise themselves and ask if there is questions
**Strategy 3:** Share own screen


###### Common problems

* one person asking a lot
* larger / technical problems
* too little time


###### How to be an exercise leader

[How to be an exercise leader](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/)


##### Before 

* check out the exercises 
    * every lesson has a "List of Exercises" under "References"
    * note that some exercises are optional (and will probably not be done during workshop unless people are very fast)
> think about what you would like to convey as exercise leader to the classroom. How did (or does) CodeRefinery help you?
* if interested, check out instructor guide of lessons


##### During

* [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
* Positive learning environment
    * encourage learning from each other
    * acknowledge difficulties and confusions
    * introductory round and camera
* Rename yourself in zoom to reflect your team name and that you are EL


##### Please do not

* Take over learners keyboard, you can share commands in chat
* Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)
* Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. 
* Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions
* Pretend to know more than you do. Better to put a question on HackMD then. Trust.
* Use “just”, “easy”, "simply", "basic", "trivial" or other demotivating words. 
* “I can’t believe you don’t know X” 


#### 6. Path ahead

Would you like to
* become an instructor?
* help organizing a workshop?
* contribute to lesson material?
* have any other ideas to contribute?
* community calls in future: see https://coderefinery.org/organization/meetings/

See our [website](https://coderefinery.org/get-involved/) and [Manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/contributing/)
Best way to get started is to join the [zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com)


#### 7. Open questions?


#### 8. Installation help

Exercise Leaders are an essential part of the CodeRefinery workshop team and allow CodeRefinery to scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.  During a (n online) workshop, Exercise leaders will be in a breakout room (virtual side room) with around 5 people, guide them through the course, keep time, and let us know when more help is needed during the exercise sessions. Instructors and expert helpers are always just one click away. 
It is very likely that you'll grow as a mentor and learn how to be a more efficient teacher. 

## Background: hierarchical workshops to scale

Traditionally, a workshop has instructors and exercise leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on *exercise leaders* a lot more, to run a
breakout room.  An exercise leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.

## What is needed to be an exercise leader?

Most importantly, *you do not have to know everything* (we don't, either), but you are expected to:

- Have been to a CodeRefinery before and used git some since then, OR have some general experience with git (branching,
  pull requests) and command line work, OR be able to generally follow
  the path of the exercises that we have laid out.

- Be present in your assigned breakout room during exercise sessions of the workshop.

- Show a positive, motivating attitude to learners.

- Keep exercises going and let us know when there are difficult questions!

- Come to a one-hour "Exercise leader onboarding" (see below) before the workshop.

> If you aren't sure if you can be an exercise leader: you probably can be one!


## Teams

We try to arrange people in teams which stay together for all breakout
sessions on all days.  This allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same breakout
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can't attend.

We sometimes allow people to register as teams: This could for example be a group colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge on the tools presented in the workhop. This person can act as exercise leader for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers. Since teams with exercise leaders are 'self-sustaining' we usually accept all team registrations, while registrations as single learner may be put on waiting list or, if applicable redirected to the stream, when they exceed our capacity based on the number of individual exercise leaders. 


## Exercise leader onboarding

We usually offer two one-hour timeslots in the week before the workshop (check the schedule!) for exercise leader onboarding. You are expected to join one of these times. During this time, we will talk about the role of the exercise leader during the workshop and answer any open questions you may have. We will also go through the material below.

## Material for exercise leaders

If you have been to a CodeRefinery workshop before, you will most likely know the following, but if unsure, also check these links: 

- {ref}`HackMD mechanics <how-to-hackmd>`
- {ref}`Zoom mechanics <how-to-zoom>` (if the workshop uses Zoom)
- "How to attend" whatever kind of workshop we are doing (though we
  will cover this the first day, too): {ref}`how to attend via livestream
  <attend-stream>`, {ref}`how to attend via Zoom <attend-online>`, or 
  {ref}`how to attend in-person <attend-inperson>`.

If you have any doubts, questions, ideas or anything you want to tell
us apart from these sessions, please let us know! We are here to help. 

If you want to contact us before the workshop you can send an email to our general email address <support@coderefinery.org> or you can join the
{doc}`CodeRefinery chat <chat>` (we recommend the `#workshops` stream,
and if you can't find it then `#general` is good). During the
workshop, we use a topic in `#workshop-chat` to coordinate (exercise
leaders do *not* need to use this, use HackMD instead).

During the workshop, HackMD (collaborative document) is our main communication channel, where you can ask questions or request us to visit your breakout room in case of tricky questions or further discussion potential.

If you had fun being an exercise leader for the workshop, please visit our {ref}`contributing page <volunteering>` page, to find out about further volunteering possibilities within CodeRefinery.

## Tips for exercise leaders

As an exercise leader, you are what can make a breakout room / group work very
good or just normal.  This is a lot of responsibility and isn't easy,
but it's also not that complex: you aren't expected to know
everything, but instead focus on the flow.  Our guidelines below
should make it doable for everyone.

### Before the workshop

As an exercise leader, we do not expect you to know all our [CodeRefinery training material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) but if you have time:

- Take a look at the exercises in advance of each days (revised
  lessons tend to have an "exercise list" page).  We try to make each
  exercise self-explanatory so that you can easily lead, but if you do one
  thing, scan over the exercises and understand the general point of each of them.
- Be ready to introduce yourself in one or two sentences to your breakout room: think about what you
  would like to convey as exercise leader to the classroom. How did (or does) CodeRefinery help you?
- If you are interested, also read through the instructor guides for the lessons (there should be
  a link at the top or sidebar of each lesson).

### During the workshop

#### Code of Conduct

Teaching isn't about helping those who are already "in", it is for
those who aren't.  Thus, we follow [a code Codee of
Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/) for all our
interactions before, during and after workshops.

If you see anything that is not supporting an equal learning environment,
please mention it to one of instructors.

#### Creating a positive learning environment

As an exercise leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:

- Encourage learners to learn from each other.
- Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your breakoutroom will
  learn more working together.
- Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
  Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
  instructors. You are our eyes and ears.
- As we said, you don't have to know everything, just like learners don't
  necessarily know everything (we don't know everything, either). It's more
  important to be responsive and work together.
- In an online workshop: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first breakout room session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your breakoutroom, be present and encourage learners to ask questions.
- In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
  convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student's
  wont.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
  don't look ready.

#### Things you should not do in a workshop

- Take over the learner's keyboard (neither physically nor remotely). It is rarely a good idea to type anything
  for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
  implies you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to
  wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
  memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
  to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the zoom chat and write the commands that they should type.
- Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
  learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)
- Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
  shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
  someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
  them.
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
  in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
  at the workshop.
- Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
  are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
  ask questions and seek help.
- Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
  that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
  they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.
- Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can't
  believe you don't know X” or “You've never heard of Y?” signals to the
  learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
  are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
  from asking questions in the future.

### In the breakout room

As an exercise leader in a breakout room, your main task is to *keep people talking
and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to
work on the exercises together.*

- You can always start by greeting people and asking how the lesson is
  going
- Encourage people to turn on cameras
- You can use chat within breakout rooms: Chat to "Everyone" in a
  breakout room only means people in that room.
- There are several strategies below.  Combine as needed - read the
  room and see what they want, but do provide encouragement to do
  something.
- If you need extra help, write it in the HackMD, someone should be
  watching it and relay it to the host. Expert helpers/instructors will try to
  visit your rooms periodically, anyway.
- Watch the time and try to keep things moving.  If some debugging
  takes to long, it's reasonable to ask for an expert helper who might
  have seen the problem before.
    - If any one problem takes too long, it's OK to say "we don't have
      time, let's come back"
    - Or, ask for an expert helper to come by and maybe answer
      quickly, or break off to work on a solution.

#### Breakout room strategies

There are several strategies you can use to run your breakout room:

Strategy 1:
- **Exercise leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.**
- You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
  screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.
  - If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.
  - That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.
- Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.
- When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
  and maybe even continue from there

Strategy 2:
- **Everyone does the exercises themselves, and once someone has a
  question, encourage them to share the screen and you discuss.**
- If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that no
  one starts off.

Strategy 3:
- **You can also share the screen if no one is willing to.**
- It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
  if no one volunteers.

#### Common problems

- One learner asks very many questions, ends up monopolizing all of
  the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
  may not get the exercises done
    - Call an expert helper to the room.  They should be circulating,
      so let them know to spend some more time
    - It can be very hard to say "no", but it's more important to have
      balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
      to say no, you can try things such as "I'm sorry, but in order
      to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
      later - would you like to watch?"
- There is some sort of problem that ends up taking a lot of time
    - Work on it for a minute or two.
    - Ask for an expert helper to drop by, by writing in the HackMD.
      Nothing wrong with this.
