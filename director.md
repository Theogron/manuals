# Director

The director manages the flow of the course, and in particular the
flow when things do *not* go according to plan.


* Gives introductions and wrap-ups (to the days, sessions, and
  instructors), or at least ensures they happen.
* Ensures good flow of the course overall
  * Is aware enough of the schedule so that they can decisively adjust
    it when needed.
  * Keeps time, ensures breaks
  * Actively discusses with the instructors about these practical
    arrangements (e.g. negotiating best break times)
* (livestreaming) Flips the livestream scenes when necessary, cues
  instructors.
