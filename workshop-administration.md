# Pre-workshop

- Announce registration
- Email persons who registered to notify-me form
- Maintain waiting list if needed
- Workshop coordinator organizes a call with all instructors and helpers to discuss the schedule to leave no doubts about timing
- Send out practical information, including installation instructions, 2-3 week ahead. Also ask those without Eduroam to speak up. 
  [Here is a template](templates/templates/practical-info-to-participants.txt)
- Organize sticky notes
- Organize catering
- Organize extension cables if needed
- Organize alternative wireless for those without Eduroam (if any)
- Prepare a shared Google doc with global write permissions, consider creating a memorable short-link


# Create exercise repositories

- Collaborative Git and documentation lessons require exercise repositories to
  be set up. For this follow the instructor guides in the lesson material.


# As people arrive

- Emphasize to people that you need to sit with someone - don't work alone.
- Try to have people sit next to someone with a simliar operating
  system if they have no preference, since they will face similar
  problems.


# Introduction talk

# During workshop

- Keep up interactive feel by encouraging and asking questions
- Keep time
- For presentations which have shell commands, create a
  cheatsheet/reference on the board in real time.
- Remind people about sticky notes.
- Make sure we take regular breaks (at least a short break each hour)
- Give participants some time to also experiment (do not rush the classroom through exercises)
- Encourage optional feedback at the end of each day on sticky notes
- Create GitHub issues for points which are confusing or problematic
- Take active part even in the lessons you're not teaching, e.g. by asking 
  questions and (politely) interject with clarifications when you think 
  something is confusing to the learners
