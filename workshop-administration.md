# Create exercise repositories

- Collaborative Git and documentation lessons require exercise repositories to
  be set up. For this follow the instructor guides in the lesson material.


# As people arrive

- Emphasize to people that you need to sit with someone - don't work alone.
- Try to have people sit next to someone with a simliar operating
  system if they have no preference, since they will face similar
  problems.
