### Targeted marketing
- Learners (many sub-categories with different time vs need trade-offs: students, junior researchers, senior researchers, lifelong learning) (join a workshop)
- Exercise leaders (bring your friends, join to learn more and lead groups)
- Research leaders (people who can tell their students they need to attend CR)
- University staff (Computing, open sci, etc.) (people who can serve as local organizers and serve as local helpers)
- Potential instructors (teach, etc.)
- High-level management (provide us funding)

### Workshop page

### Communication

  - remind team contacts to update team info

## Continuous/ every few days:
- check indico and follow up on registrations
   - look at team registrations and check for problems
     - identify where we need to do something. e.g. persons who wanted an in-person room. or persons who were not sure but wanted to be informed. basically, "playing" with the registration data now is important to not forget anybody and not to forget follow-up
   - look at exercise leads and make sure they registered also for the onboarding
   - try to approve as early as possible
 - check Freshdesk for new support requests
- after every workshop day, send summary and preparation for next day email to all

## After the workshop

- Port changes from workshop page to template page
- Check this page and update if necessary for future workshops
  - Document necessary steps and form rigid workflow
- Save detailed schedule in each lesson page and link to it from workshop page
  -As the schedule and workshop content is quite established at this point can we include as much actual content to the workshop page temlpate repo? Maybe fork/copy it so we still preserve the blank temlpate for WSaaS
- Post-Wrokshop survey
  - Create draft
  - Create in Indico
  - Send
- archive and display statistics
- summarize lessons learned and make it a blog post
- summarize what we did in a todo list and place it in the manual
- remove the exercise repositories
- move from upcoming to past
