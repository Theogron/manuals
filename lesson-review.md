# Lesson review

This presents a checklist for reviewing lessons that already exist.
You should also read [lesson-design.md](lesson-design.md) as well -
this is roughly a checklist to the things there.

This is roughly sorted from highest priority for short review to
lowest priority for big refactorings.


## Instructor's guide

- What sections should be taught for what audiences?
- Common pitfalls
- Any required setup in advance
- After you're done analyzing, is there anything in the maintainer's
  guide you need to update?
- Reminder about what part of the instructor's laptop environment
  should be reset.


## Lesson overview

- Is the introduction intrinsically motivating enough?  Does it
  promote an emotional connection to existing problems?
- Student's guide and framing: will a student know when this is
  relevant to them and how it will benefit them?
- Are the difficulty and prerequisites stated?


## Episode overview

- Read the intro and conclusion to every section/episode.
  - Do they make sense in order?
  - Are they motivating/wrapping up well enough?
- Do they have learning objectives at top and food for thought at the
  bottom?

## Episode details

- Read through each exercise (with no other text in between).  Does it
  make a logical progression?
- Exercises labeled with difficulty, optional, etc.
- Optional advanced exercises in places where advanced users may get
  bored.
- Each exercise is self-contained: a helper can read just the exercise
  area and get an idea of what is supposed to happen and why.


## Major Refactorings

Always start with the big picture: does it make sense?

After the above, do the details.  Remember the guides still.

Before you start major refactoring and rewriting, think if it makes
sense.  Have you figured out why it's the way it is based on the
instructor's guide?  If you do a big refactoring, make sure you update
the maintainer's guide!

Before you embark on a big refactoring step, please pitch your idea
in a GitHub issue and collect feedback from others.
