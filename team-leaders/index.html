the schedule!) for team leader onboarding. You are expected to join one of
these times. During this time, we will talk about the role of the exercise
leader during the workshop and answer any open questions you may have. We will
also go through the material below.</p>

<p>As a team leader, we do not expect you to know all our <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/lessons/">CodeRefinery training material</a> but if you have time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Take a look at the exercises in advance</strong> of each days (revised
lessons tend to have an “exercise list” page).  We try to make each
exercise self-explanatory so that you can easily lead, but if you do one
thing, scan over the exercises and understand the general point of each of them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be ready to introduce yourself</strong> in one or two sentences to your breakout room: think about what you
would like to convey as team leader to the classroom. How did (or does) CodeRefinery help you?</p></li>
<li><p>If you are interested, also read through the <strong>instructor guides</strong> for the lessons (there should be
a link at the top or sidebar of each lesson).</p></li>

<h2>Your task during exercise sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#your-task-during-exercise-sessions" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As a team leader in a breakout room, your main task is to <strong>keep people talking
and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to
work on the exercises together</strong>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can always start by <strong>greeting</strong> people and asking how the lesson is
going</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage people to <strong>turn on cameras</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can use chat within breakout rooms: Chat to “Everyone” in a
breakout room only means people in that room.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several strategies below.  Combine as needed - <strong>read the
room and see what they want</strong>, but do <strong>provide encouragement</strong> to do
something.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you need extra help, write it in the HackMD</strong>, someone should be
watching it and relay it to the host. Expert helpers/instructors will try to
visit your rooms periodically, anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watch the time</strong> and try to keep things moving.  If some debugging
takes to long, it’s reasonable to ask for an expert helper who might
have seen the problem before.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If any one problem takes too long, it’s OK to say “we don’t have
time, let’s come back”</p></li>
<li><p>Or, ask for an expert helper to come by and maybe answer
quickly, or break off to work on a solution.</p></li>

<h2>Strategies for exercise rooms<a class="headerlink" href="#strategies-for-exercise-rooms" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are several strategies you can use to run your breakout room:</p>
<p>Strategy 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>team leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.</p></li>
<li><p>That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
and maybe even continue from there</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Everyone does the exercises themselves, and once someone has a
question, encourage them to share the screen and you discuss.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that no
one starts off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 3:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>You can also share the screen if no one is willing to.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
if no one volunteers.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-a-positive-learning-environment">
<h2>Create a positive learning environment<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-positive-learning-environment" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As a team leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your breakoutroom will
learn more working together.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
instructors. You are our eyes and ears.</p></li>
<li><p>As we said, you don’t have to know everything, just like learners don’t
necessarily know everything (we don’t know everything, either). It’s more
important to be responsive and work together.</p></li>
<li><p>In an online workshop: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first breakout room session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your breakoutroom, be present and encourage learners to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p>In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student’s
wont.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
don’t look ready.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="common-problems-in-exercise-rooms">
<h2>Common problems in exercise rooms<a class="headerlink" href="#common-problems-in-exercise-rooms" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>One learner asks very many questions</strong>, ends up monopolizing all of
the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
may not get the exercises done</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Call an expert helper to the room.  They should be circulating,
so let them know to spend some more time</p></li>
<li><p>It can be very hard to say “no”, but it’s more important to have
balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
to say no, you can try things such as “I’m sorry, but in order
to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
later - would you like to watch?”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There is some sort of problem that ends up taking a <strong>lot of time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on it for a minute or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for an expert helper to drop by, by writing in the HackMD.
Nothing wrong with this.</p></li>

<h2>Things to avoid<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-avoid" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Shorter version</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Take over learners keyboard, you can share commands in chat</p></li>
<li><p>Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or learners who use them (Excel, Windows, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend to know more than you do. Better to put a question on HackMD then. Trust.</p></li>
<li><p>Use “just”, “easy”, “simply”, “basic”, “trivial” or other demotivating words.</p></li>
<li><p>“I can’t believe you don’t know X”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Longer version</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Take over the learner’s keyboard (neither physically nor remotely). It is rarely a good idea to type anything
for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
implies you don’t think they can do it themselves or that you don’t want to
wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the zoom chat and write the commands that they should type.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
at the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p>Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can’t
believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals to the
learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
from asking questions in the future.</p></li>

<h2>Background: hierarchical workshops to scale<a class="headerlink" href="#background-hierarchical-workshops-to-scale" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, a workshop has instructors and team leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on <em>team leaders</em> a lot more, to run a
breakout room. A team leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.</p>
<p>team leaders are an essential part of the CodeRefinery workshop team and
allow CodeRefinery to scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.
During a (n online) workshop, team leaders will be in a breakout room
(virtual side room) with around 5 people, guide them through the course, keep
time, and let us know when more help is needed during the exercise sessions.
Instructors and expert helpers are always just one click away.  It is very
likely that you’ll grow as a mentor and learn how to be a more efficient
teacher.</p>

<h2>What is needed to be a team leader?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-needed-to-be-a-team-leader" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Most importantly, <em>you do not have to know everything</em> (we don’t, either), but you are expected to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have been to a CodeRefinery before and used git some since then, OR have some general experience with git (branching,
pull requests) and command line work, OR be able to generally follow
the path of the exercises that we have laid out.</p></li>
<li><p>Be present in your assigned breakout room during exercise sessions of the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Show a positive, motivating attitude to learners.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep exercises going and let us know when there are difficult questions!</p></li>
<li><p>Come to a one-hour “team leader onboarding” (see below) before the workshop.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you aren’t sure if you can be a team leader: you probably can be one!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background-teams">
<h2>Background: Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#background-teams" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We try to arrange people in teams which stay together for all breakout
sessions on all days.  This allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same breakout
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can’t attend.</p>
<p>We sometimes allow people to register as teams: This could for example be a
group colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge
on the tools presented in the workhop. This person can act as team leader
for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way
you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and
discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers. Since teams
with team leaders are ‘self-sustaining’ we usually accept all team
registrations, while registrations as single learner may be put on waiting list
or, if applicable redirected to the stream, when they exceed our capacity based
on the number of individual team leaders.</p>

<p>If you have any doubts, questions, ideas or anything you want to tell
us apart from these sessions, please let us know! We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you want to contact us before the workshop you can send an email to our general email address <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;coderefinery&#46;org">support<span>&#64;</span>coderefinery<span>&#46;</span>org</a> or you can join the
<a class="reference internal" href="../chat/"><span class="doc">CodeRefinery chat</span></a> (we recommend the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#workshops</span></code> stream,
and if you can’t find it then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#general</span></code> is good). During the
workshop, we use a topic in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#workshop-chat</span></code> to coordinate (exercise
leaders do <em>not</em> need to use this, use HackMD instead).</p>
<p>During the workshop, HackMD (collaborative document) is our main communication channel, where you can ask questions or request us to visit your breakout room in case of tricky questions or further discussion potential.</p>
