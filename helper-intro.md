# Helper introduction

Thanks for being a CodeRefinery helper!  Helpers allow CodeRefinery to
scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.  You'll be
in a breakout room with around 5 people, and guide them through the
course.  You'll also learn to be a more effective teacher and mentor.

As a helper, you are expected to:

- Show a good attitude to learners.

- Have been to a CodeRefinery before and used git some, or have a bit
  more some experience with git (branching, pull request, github).

- Come to a one-hour "helper training" before the workshop.

- *Not know everything*, but keep exercises going and call us when
   there are difficult questions!

## Helper training

During this time, we will talk about the role of the helper during the
workshop and answer any open questions you may have.  We'll go through the material below.

If you have any doubts, questions, ideas or anything you want to tell us apart from these sessions, please write your question here* and we will try to answer asap or you can send an email to <support@coderefinery.org>.

## Reading

We have these things we recommend you read in advance (don't worry,
we'll go over them in helper training):

- [Helping-and-teaching](Basics of being a good, motivating helper)
- [How breakout rooms work](breakout-rooms-helping)


You'll learn these during the workshop so *you don't need to read
these in advance* (and if you've been to a CodeRefinery before, you'll
know this):

- [HackMD mechanics](hackmd-mechanics)
- [Zoom mechanics](zoom-mechanics)
- Not bad to read hints on [how to attend
  online](how-to-attend-online) or [how to attend
  in-person](how-to-attend-inperson).
