# Workshop checklist template

This page is a check list that we use when planning a CodeRefinery workshop
with 300 or more participants - it is copied to a HackMD.  Detailed
descriptions are in the roles pages.
It may also help with the organization of other workshops.

Please keep it brief and copy-paste-able to HackMD/HedgeDoc for the actual planning.
