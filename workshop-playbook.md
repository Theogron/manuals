# Workshop playbook

It may also help with the organization of other workshops.

**Targeted marketing**

Some thoughts on target groups that should be tried to be reached:

- Learners (many sub-categories with different time vs need trade-offs: students, junior researchers, senior researchers, lifelong learning) (join a workshop)
- Exercise leaders (bring your friends, join to learn more and lead groups)
- Research leaders (people who can tell their students they need to attend CR)
- University staff (Computing, open sci, etc.) (people who can serve as local organizers and serve as local helpers)
- Potential instructors (teach, etc.)
- High-level management (provide us funding)
