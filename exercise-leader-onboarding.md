### 1. Introduction, Icebreaker, Zulip

> CodeRefinery: We are working with students, researchers, and research software engineers from all disciplines to advance FAIRness of software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

* Get familiar with HackMD 

[HackMD Mechanics](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/)

* Shortly introduce yourself in zoom
    * Who are you?
    * What do you do?
    * Where are you connecting from?

* If you want to, sign up for our [zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) to ask us anything, anytime. Use `#tools-workshop` during the workshop itself (you need to join the stream)

### 2. Learners survey

(we used to ask learners to fill out a pre-workshop survey; this is discontinued now but results of the surveys still apply)
Let's take a quick look at previous courses survey results:

[Schedule](https://coderefinery.org/2022-09-22-workshop/#schedule) with link to lesson material and exercises

#### Interactive stream?

* Instructor zoom is streamed
    * watch material, watch demo, type along
* Learner zoom for exercise sessions in breakoutrooms
* Stream for everyone
* interaction of everyone via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/workshop-2022-september)

### 4. Exercise sessions

* instructor should clearly tell which exercises and for how long; if you don't know please clarify via HackMD

#### Teams?

##### preformed teams

* learners could sign up as team
* the goal is to keep preformed teams together 

##### single learner teams

* learners could sign up alone but request to do the exercises in team
* -> 2 open breakoutrooms
* Additional rooms for specific problem solving 
* Learners can also create own team 


#### Want extra help?

:::warning
**It is ok to not know something!**
:::

We have structures in place to help you if there is questions that you cannot answer (HackMD, expert helpers)

Use HackMD:

* to ask (and answer) general questions that came up in your room 
* to call for more help from our expert helpers

#### During exercise sessions

[Helping in breakoutrooms](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/breakout-rooms-helping/#helpers-in-breakout-rooms)

* keep people talking and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to work on the exercises together.
* Greeting
* cameras
* Chat to “Everyone” in a breakout room only means people in that room.
* read the room and see what they want, but do provide encouragement to do something.
* keep time and ask for extra help with debugging

##### Strategies

**Strategy 1:** Encourage to share screen
**Strategy 2:** Everyone does exercise themselves and ask if there is questions
**Strategy 3:** Share own screen

---

##### Common problems

* one person asking a lot
* larger / technical problems
* too little time

##### How to be an exercise leader

[How to be an exercise leader](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/)

---
#### Before 

* check out the exercises 
    * every lesson has a "List of Exercises" under "References"
    * note that some exercises are optional (and will probably not be done during workshop unless people are very fast)
> think about what you would like to convey as exercise leader to the classroom. How did (or does) CodeRefinery help you?
* if interested, check out instructor guide of lessons

----

#### During

* [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
* Positive learning environment
    * encourage learning from each other
    * acknowledge difficulties and confusions
    * introductory round and camera
* Rename yourself in zoom to reflect your team name and that you are EL

----

#### Please do not

* Take over learners keyboard, you can share commands in chat
* Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)
* Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. 
* Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions
* Pretend to know more than you do. Better to put a question on HackMD then. Trust.
* Use “just”, “easy”, "simply", "basic", "trivial" or other demotivating words. 
* “I can’t believe you don’t know X”
